<p>This project template is the basis of an expansion board for a
ATTiny programming/testing/demonstrating project (ATTiny
Examples).<br/>
<br/>
This base project includes an expansion board
for the Raspberry-Pi PCB with two ATTiny (on 84 and one 85) devices. 
That expansion board has an expansion slot as well, and this template
is the basis for that expansion board. <br/>
