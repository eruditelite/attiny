# attiny -- a template for ATTiny84/ATTiny85 using Raspberry Pi #

## Overview ##

Most of the ATTiny examples seem to be based on the Arduino.  As I
wanted a simple example using the Raspberry Pi (the reason for all of
this is controlling telescopes using lin_guider etc.), I decided to
write this all down so I could remember it later!
